I'm Henrique Santana, a Principal Cloud Support Engineer at AWS with over 15 years of experience in infrastructure operations. I help teams run containers at scale and, increasingly, build infrastructure for generative AI and machine learning workloads.

## What I Do

I specialize in container technologies—**Amazon ECS** and **Amazon EKS**—helping customers run everything from traditional microservices to large-scale AI/ML inference workloads. Lately, I've been deep in the intersection of containers and generative AI, working with teams deploying LLMs, training pipelines, and GPU-accelerated workloads on Kubernetes.

My day-to-day includes:

- Solving complex technical problems for container and AI workloads
- Managing critical escalations when things break at scale
- Writing technical content for the AWS blog
- Speaking at conferences about what actually works (and what doesn't)

## Speaking & Community

I speak at technical conferences when I have something worth sharing:

- AWS re:Invent
- KubeCon
- AWS Community events

The goal is always to share what I've learned from real production systems—the successes, the failures, and the lessons in between.

## Technical Focus

What I work with most:

- **Container Orchestration**: Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS, Kubernetes
- **AI/ML Infrastructure**: GPU clusters, LLM inference, training pipelines
- **Infrastructure Operations**: Automation, monitoring, keeping things running
- **Cloud Architecture**: AWS services, serverless containers, event-driven systems

## Writing

I contribute to the [AWS Containers Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/) when I have something useful to share:

- Container best practices that actually work in production
- Monitoring and observability patterns
- Running AI/ML workloads on Kubernetes
- Event-driven architectures

## Connect

I'm always interested in connecting with fellow engineers, speaking at events, or discussing container technologies.
