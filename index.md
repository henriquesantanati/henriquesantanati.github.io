# Hi, I'm Henrique Santana 👋

Principal Cloud Support Engineer at AWS with over 15 years of experience in infrastructure operations. I help teams run containers at scale and build infrastructure for generative AI and machine learning workloads.

I specialize in **Amazon ECS** and **Amazon EKS**, working with everything from traditional microservices to large-scale AI/ML inference, LLMs, and GPU-accelerated workloads on Kubernetes.

Speaker at AWS re:Invent, KubeCon, and other technical conferences. I write about what actually works in production on the [AWS Containers Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/).
