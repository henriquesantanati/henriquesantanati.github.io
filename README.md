# Henrique Santana's Personal Website

Personal website and blog built collaboratively with AI assistance.

## About This Project

This site is built and maintained through a collaborative workflow with an AI assistant. I focus on content direction and what I want to say, while the AI handles the technical implementation, allowing me to maintain a professional web presence without getting bogged down in the details.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Jekyll 4.3
- **Theme**: [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) (modern, dark mode)
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages
- **Deployment**: Automatic via GitHub Actions

## Site Structure

- **Homepage**: Introduction + recent posts
- **About**: Professional bio, speaking, technical focus
- **Blog**: Technical posts about containers, AI/ML, and infrastructure
- **Categories/Tags**: Auto-generated content organization

## Topics

I write about:
- Container orchestration (Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS, Kubernetes)
- AI/ML infrastructure and GPU workloads
- Infrastructure operations at scale
- Production lessons from real-world systems

## Collaboration Workflow

I write all my own content. The AI assistant helps with:
- Technical implementation (site structure, features, configuration)
- Design tweaks and layout changes
- Polishing and refining blog posts
- Managing deployments and updates

This approach lets me focus on writing and ideas while technical implementation is handled efficiently.
