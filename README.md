# Henrique Santana's Personal Website

Personal website and blog built collaboratively with Aki, an AI assistant.

## About This Project

This site is built and maintained through a collaborative workflow where I guide Aki to implement features, write content, and manage the technical aspects. Rather than manually running commands or editing files, I describe what I want and Aki handles the implementation.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Jekyll 4.3
- **Theme**: [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) (modern, dark mode)
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages
- **Deployment**: Automatic via GitHub Actions

## Site Structure

- **Homepage**: Introduction + recent posts
- **About**: Professional bio, speaking, technical focus
- **Blog**: Technical posts about containers, AI/ML, and infrastructure
- **Categories/Tags**: Auto-generated content organization

## Collaboration Workflow

All site updates happen through conversation with Aki:
- Content creation (blog posts, pages)
- Design tweaks and layout changes
- Configuration updates
- New features and sections

This approach allows me to focus on content and direction while Aki handles the technical implementation.
