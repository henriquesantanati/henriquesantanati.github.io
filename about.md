# About Me

I'm Henrique Santana, a Principal Cloud Support Engineer at AWS with over 15 years of experience in infrastructure operations. My passion lies in helping organizations modernize their technology stacks through container adoption and cloud-native architectures.

## What I Do

I specialize in container technologies, particularly **Amazon ECS** and **Amazon EKS**, where I help customers design, deploy, and optimize containerized workloads at scale. My work involves:

- Delivering expert technical support for complex container deployments
- Managing critical customer escalations
- Contributing to AWS blogs and technical documentation
- Speaking at international conferences about container best practices

## Speaking & Community

I'm an active member of the cloud and containers community, speaking at major technical conferences including:

- AWS re:Invent
- KubeCon
- Various AWS Community events

I believe in sharing knowledge and empowering teams to build scalable, resilient cloud architectures.

## Technical Focus

My expertise spans:

- **Container Orchestration**: Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS, Kubernetes
- **Infrastructure Operations**: Automation, monitoring, high availability
- **Cloud Architecture**: AWS services, serverless containers, event-driven systems
- **DevOps Practices**: CI/CD, infrastructure as code, observability

## Publications

I regularly contribute technical content to the [AWS Containers Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/), covering topics like:

- ECS and EKS best practices
- Container monitoring and observability
- Migration strategies
- Event-driven architectures with containers

## Connect

I'm always interested in connecting with fellow engineers, speaking at events, or discussing container technologies.
